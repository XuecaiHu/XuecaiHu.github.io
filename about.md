I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Beijing Normal University's Artificial Intelligence Institute. I completed co-Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China in 2021, under the supervision of Dr. Tieniu Tan at CASIA & NLPR and Dr. Zilei Wang at USTC. My research focuses on computer vision, with specific interests in areas such as pose estimation, image super-resolution,semantic segmentation and Multimodal Large Model.
